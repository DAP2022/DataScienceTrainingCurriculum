# Welcome to the Data Science Training Curriculum Website

Regardless of your specific domain (i.e. business, science, social sciences), Data Science allows the 
transduction of **raw data** into actionable **wisdom**.

**AI magnifies capability, not its absence. Like any FORCE MULTIPLIER, when the base is zero, the product is zero. Foundational competence is the prerequisite for amplification!**

Processing, modeling, and interpreting the data requires skills from three general disciplines: 
1. Programming
2. Statistics
3. Critical Thinking
   
We have created 12-hour mini-courses in each of the three categories, along with 90-minute workshops

Materials for these courses can be found here!
