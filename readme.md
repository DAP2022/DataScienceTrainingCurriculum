transduction of **raw data** into actionable **wisdom**.

## AI magnifies capability, not its absence. Like any *FORCE MULTIPLIER*, when the base is zero, the product is zero. Foundational competence is the prerequisite for amplification!

Processing, modeling, and interpreting the data requires skills from *three* general disciplines: 

1. Programming
2. Statistics
3. Critical Thinking
   
We have created 12-hour mini-courses in each of the three categories, along with 90-minute workshops
