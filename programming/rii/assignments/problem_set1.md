Please explain your steps. Fully utilize the power of RStudio (Posit) by using Markdown cells AND R chunks (don't just use R chunks with hashed out comments). Use a new rmd file for your assignment and please use a format such as: Lastname_Firstname_PS1.rmd so that when I go through and mark/comment, it is straightforward for me to see that it is yours. Thank you!

Q1.    Use one of the following built-in datasets (iris or OrchardSprays) to do the following: 
a.    Load in the data from the built-in R datasets.
b.    Inspect the dataframe with at least three attributes (explain what you choose and how it is implemented). 
c.    Slice out rows and columns using any criteria that you wish, explain what the criteria is (and why), and then write it to an external file. 
d.    Slice out the rows or columns using Boolean conditions. 
e.    Subset the data in any way that you think is meaningful (explain why it is meaningful to you). 
f.    Use tapply to breakdown the mean values of one of the columns based on the factors in the dataset. 

Q2. Use the HairEyeColor built-in dataset for basic R to create a mosaic plot. This will be a similar process to what we did in class. Ask and answer, using a graph, a question based on this table.

Q3. Use the built-in data set for ggplot2, msleep, to create a visualization using ggpplot and geoms (not base R) that answers questions about mammals sleeping.
