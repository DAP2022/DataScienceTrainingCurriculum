Please explain your steps. Fully utilize the power of RStudio (Posit) by using Markdown cells AND R chunks (don't just use R chunks with hashed out comments). Use a new rmd file for your assignment and please use a format such as: Lastname_Firstname_PS1.rmd so that when I go through and mark/comment, it is straightforward for me to see that it is yours. Thank you!

## Q1. Use one of the following built-in datasets (iris or OrchardSprays) to do the following: 
- Load in the data from the built-in R datasets.
- Inspect the dataframe with at least three attributes (explain what you choose and how it is implemented).
- Slice out rows and columns using any criteria that you wish, explain what the criteria is (and why), and then write it to an external file.
- Slice out the rows or columns using Boolean conditions.
- Subset the data in any way that you think is meaningful (explain why it is meaningful to you).
- Use tapply to breakdown the mean values of one of the columns based on the factors in the dataset. 

## Q2. Use the HairEyeColor built-in dataset for basic R to create a mosaic plot. 
- This will be a similar process to what we did in class. Ask and answer, using a graph, a question based on this table.

## Q3. Use the built-in data set for ggplot2, msleep, to create a visualization using ggpplot and geoms (not base R) that answers questions about mammals sleeping.
