## Module 4 AB Title: The Normal Distribution, testing assumptions and Student's t Tests

## Goals:
- Testing for Normality:
- Visualization: q-q plots
- wilk test
- You will simulate normally distributed data sets and non-normally distributed data sets (ex. Poisson Distributed data sets)
- You will compare the results of parametric tests (t-tests) under data that is normally distributed and non-normally distributed to investigate the robustness of the t-test against violations of assumptions.
- You will use the one sample t-test, two sample t-test and paired t-test and see how the arguments change when specifying which type to t-test to use
- You will look at the power of the t-test
- You will look at var.test to ensure that two distributions have similar distributions.
- We will examine the non-parametric alternatives to these tests (Welch’s approximate t test, Wilcoxon test)
Kaplan Meier curves

## Activities:
- Use data sets to investigate normality, test a hypothesis with all appropriate examinations of the data (normality etc.), and produce a Kaplan-Meier curve for a built-in data set.
