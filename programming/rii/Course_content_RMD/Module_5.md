## Module 5AB - Title: ANOVA and linear correlation/regression

## Goals:
- You will adequately test assumptions of the ANOVA test using bartlett to test for homogeneity of variances
- You will use the nonparametric version of ANOVA, kruskal.test()
- You will use tukeyHSD to identify which of the groups has a different mean value
- You will use the tapply function to create a plot of the variances versus the mean values of the groups.
- You will explore and contrast linear regression and linear correlation
- You will test assumptions to ensure that they are using the appropriate tests
- You will calculate Pearson's correlation, and nonparametric alternatives (Spearman, Kendall)
- You will explore the residuals and calculate confidence intervals

## Activities:
- Reproducing similar analysis on different data sets.
