## Module 3AB - Title: Hypothesis Testing: a pipeline for your thinking
- Statistical analysis using R
- Goodness of fit Tests: Chi squared, Fisher’s Exact test
- to refresh your memory about hypothesis testing and big concepts in type I/II errors, power, sensitivity, specificity, I have put together a short pdf that can be found in the Course_content_RMD folder.
- INSERT THE LINK TO THE PDF HERE

## Goals:
- Revisit the general outline of Hypothesis Testing (4 steps, null/alternate hypothesis, p-values, Type I, Type II error). See this compressed pdf with images of the major statistical concepts:  
- Build up a Binomial Distribution
    - The hard way: using sample, pbinom(), tidyverse etc.
    - The easy way: using binom.test() and prop.test()
- Apply the Hypothesis Testing framework to the Bumpus dataset
- Apply the chi-squared contingency test to the bumpus dataset
- Work through an example of ROC/AUC using the pROC library
- Fisher’s exact test (another type of Contingency test that is exact)

## Activities:
- Formally test a hypothesis on the Bumpus data set
- Recapitulate the ROC/AUC example
