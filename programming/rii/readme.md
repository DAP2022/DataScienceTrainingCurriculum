# Introduction to RII
** This is a 12-hour mini-course offered as part of The Jackson Laboratory Data Science Training Curriculum **

## Course Description: 
This workshop is the second half of the introduction to the R programming language course. We will build on the capabilities of R as a visualization tool, through ggplot and the Tidyverse, and spend most of our time exploring the power of R for statistical analysis of datasets. Topics covered will include: ggplot and the Tidyverse philosophy, hypothesis testing, goodness-of-fit tests (chi-squared, Fisher’s exact test), Student’s t test, normal distributions, correlation, Regression, ANOVA, and non-parametric versions of these parametric tests.  

## Course Goals: 
Provide you with the tools to analyze and visualize data. By the end of the week, you will be able to:
- Compare the syntax and structure of R to the ideals of the tidyverse
- Use ggplot2 to plot your data
- Conduct and implement standard statistical tests, parametric and nonparametric hypothesis tests
