# Welcome to the Introduction to Python II.

** This is a 12-hour mini-course that is part of the Jackson Laboratory Data Science Training Program **

Build on Python basics that you learned in Introduction to Python I. 
   
## Course Description: 
This workshop is the second half of the introduction to the Python programming 
language course. We will review the fundamental capabilities of Python, undertake
a brief look at regex,  a deeper dive into functions with recursion, have an
overview of Object-Oriented Programming, and explore important libraries and
packages such as NumPy, Pandas, SQLite and any other libraries that we have time
to investigate.     

## Course Learning Outcomes: 
Provide you with the tools to take a computational problem through the process of design, implementation, documentation, and testing. By the end of the second week of Python instruction, you will be able to:
- Bundle instructions and flow into **fun**ctions
- Understand regular expressions (‘regex”) and import and use the regex module. 
- Improve the design and encapsulation of your earlier procedural Python solutions with Object-Oriented programming principles
- Have a general understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of the major types of programming: procedural, functional, object oriented and Querying (SQLite)
- Understand, Implement, and leverage commonly used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SQLite3.

## Lecture notes (Python I: Jupyter notebooks)
There is an overview and downloadable .ipynb files.  
(if you are using GitHub path, the content of the files will appear online when you click on "Download"; if you are using the website, you must download them and open them using You can open these using Google Colab or you can use whatever your favourite Jupyter Notebook software is....)
