In Modules 4 and 5, we will focus on libraries that foundational to Data Science: Numpy and Pandas. We will also encounter a library with an entirely different logic to programming: SQLite3 which uses SQL queries.

(There is an optional preview of libraries Jupyter Notebook: Module4_Overview_Of_Libraries)

## Module 4A: 
- Major libraries: NumPy
- vectorization
- subsetting, apply conditions
- the powerful np.array

## Learning Outcomes for 4A:
- Recognize:
    - Why the array object in NumPy is considered so powerful and efficient
- Implement:
    - Different slicing & subsetting techniques
    - Broadcasting across entire array

## Module 4B: 
- Major libraries: PANDAS https://pandastutor.comLinks to an external site.
- Small nod to Series
- Inputting dataframes from URL, manually, reading from a file
- The ease of dataframes
- Tiny introduction to a ‘stack’: Basic plots with matplotlib
- The many ways of manipulating data – a brief overview of an extremely large state space of possibilities
