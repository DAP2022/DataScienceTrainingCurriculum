There might be spill over from 2B so I have combined Module 3A and Module 3B into one module: Module 3AB which covers Object-Oriented Programming: 

## Module 3AB: Object-Oriented Programming
- Objects have attributes (nouns) and methods (verbs)
- Bundled, encapsulated object
- Classes
- Constructors
- Inheritance
- polymorphism

## Learning Objectives for Module 3AB:
- Recognize:
    - class is the ‘blueprint’
    - understanding what a constructor does
    - how to create an instance of a class
- Implement:
    - Build a Platypus Object
