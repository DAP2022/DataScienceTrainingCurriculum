        ">'Objects are like people. They’re living, breathing things that have knowledge inside them about how to do things and have memory inside them so they can remember things. And rather than interacting with them at a very low level, you interact with them at a very high level of abstraction, like we’re doing right here.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Here’s an example: If I’m your laundry object, you can give me your dirty clothes and send me a message that says, “Can you get my clothes laundered, please.” I happen to know where the best laundry place in San Francisco is. And I speak English, and I have dollars in my pockets. So I go out and hail a taxicab and tell the driver to take me to this place in San Francisco. I go get your clothes laundered, I jump back in the cab, I get back here. I give you your clean clothes and say, “Here are your clean clothes.”\n",
        "\n",
        ">You have no idea how I did that. You have no knowledge of the laundry place. Maybe you speak French, and you can’t even hail a taxi. You can’t pay for one, you don’t have dollars in your pocket. Yet, I knew how to do all of that. And you didn’t have to know any of it. All that complexity was hidden inside of me, and we were able to interact at a very high level of abstraction. That’s what objects are. They encapsulate complexity, and the interfaces to that complexity are high level.'\n",

        "OOP is a way to **force logical organization onto your code with conventional syntax** that will make it cleaner, easier to understand (for you and other users of your code) and much easier for future you (or someone else) to maintain. OOP is particularly valuable and important when you work on projects with multiple pieces. At this point in your coding journey, re-writing your small chunks of code to be OOP might feel like (to steal a metaphor from a colleague) \"cracking a walnut with a sledgehammer\". Of course, you might want to be skeptical of the benefits of OOP because I have basically used the same argument for functional programming (ie. when there are lots of moving parts, and you are working on a large project, functional programming might be the most efficient solution). I am pointing this out to emphasize that these are simply tools for you use - in some cases, OOP will be superior and, in others, Functional Programming will be the best to use. For small scripts (like the ones you have been creating in this course so far), imperative programming is sufficient. You should be competent in each of these three general programming domains so that you can pick the right tool for any possible problem.\n",

        "To make it a tiny bit more complex - if we know that we want a bunch of child classes to inherit attributes/methods from a parent class, we can even set up a kind of 'dummy placeholder' parent class -- called an **abstract class** -- that will never actually be instantiated itself, but will, rather just serve as a way to allow a bunch of child classes to inherit similar attributes/methods without having to define them in each individual child class.
