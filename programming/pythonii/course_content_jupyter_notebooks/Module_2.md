## Module 2A:
- Recognize:
    - Functions can call other functions
    - Functions can call themselves
    - Types of problems that are optimally solved via recursion.
- Implement:
    - For loop to access individual items in a nested tuple
    - Implement a recursion solution to a common problem

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Module 2B: 
- General overview and comparison of the three major type of programming:
    - Procedural: What we have done so far
    - Functional programming: We are going to focus on list comprehensions and higher order function (map, filter)
    - Object Oriented Programming:Encapsulation into objects
    - For the simplified MCMC code, here is an image that outlines what it is doing:
