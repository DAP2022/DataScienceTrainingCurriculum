## Course Description: 
This workshop is the second half of the introduction to the Python programming 
language course. We will review the fundamental capabilities of Python, undertake
a brief look at regex,  a deeper dive into functions with recursion, have an
overview of Object-Oriented Programming, and explore important libraries and
packages such as NumPy, Pandas, SQLite and any other libraries that we have time
to investigate.     

## Course Learning Outcomes: 
Provide you with the tools to take a computational problem through the process of design, implementation, documentation, and testing. By the end of the second week of Python instruction, you will be able to:
- Examine the tuples datatype
- Understand regular expressions (‘regex”) and import and use the regex module. 
- Improve the design and encapsulation of your earlier procedural Python solutions with Object-Oriented programming principles
- Have a general understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of the major types of programming: procedural, functional, object oriented and Querying (SQLite)
- Understand, Implement, and leverage commonly used libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, SQLite3.
