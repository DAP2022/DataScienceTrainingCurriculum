## Day 5 Assignment:

Hand in a .rmd file saved as “FirstInitialLastname_Day5.rmd” that has markdown explanations and coding chunks (with hashed out comments).
## Question 1:
Redo your visualizations from Module 4, but **use ggplot instead of Base R**. We did not cover all types of graphs, but armed with google (and a cheatsheet), this should be reasonably straightforward to translate within the ggplot layers. 

With the bumpus dataset choose a numeric trait (one of the columns such as head, humer, wgt etc):

- Using two different types of graphs, visually inspect to determine if your chosen variable is normally distributed.
- Graph a boxplot for your chosen variable that is divided by sex and survival.
- Draw a mosaic plot (Note: use a stacked bar plot scaled to 1, same as the diamond example in Module 5A, to mimic a mosaic plot) of the survival of the female versus male birds.
