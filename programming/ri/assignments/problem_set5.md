## Day 5 Assignment:

Hand in a .qmd file saved as “FirstInitialLastname_Day5.qmd” that has markdown explanations and coding chunks (with hashed out comments).

Simulate a dataset from a small randomized clinical trial created using the biostats package. The study compares Drug A vs Placebo on a continuous outcome called response. The dataset includes the variables:
 - treatment (DrugA, Placebo)
 - sex (Male, Female)
 - response (numeric)

which are the same ones that we saw in class. 

1.	 Conduct some basic exploratory data analysis. Find mean, sd and visualize any suspected relationships. 
2.	Write a single line of base R code that computes the total number of missing values in the dataset. Why is reporting only the total number of missing values often insufficient in practice? Give one concrete reason. How could you fix this issue using built-in functions in biostats? Run the command. 
3.	Briefly, in your own words, explain Simpson’s Paradox. Under what circumstance does it happen?
