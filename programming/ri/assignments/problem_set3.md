## Day 3 Assignment:

Hand in a file name "firstinitialLastname_Day3.qmd". 
## Question 1:
Using the Great Apes Dataframe, do the following:
- With slicing: Reverse the rows so that Pan Paniscus are the first two rows
- With slicing: Print out all the columns except for the height column
- With slicing: Only include males that are smaller than 120 lbs or shorter than 140 cm
- With Slicing: Add a column to your dataframe of whatever characteristic you choose (age of first reproduction, number of chromosomes etc).
- Use the subset function to reproduce the answer to "Only include males that are smaller than 120 lbs or shorter than 140 cm"
- Now that you have added a column to the Great Apes dataframe, save it (under a different name) to your RAssignments folder.
 
## Question 2:
Using the Bumpus data set: use tapply to investigate a summary statistic (ie. mean, median, sd, var) over the column of your choosing, but ensure that your information is split by sex and survival.
