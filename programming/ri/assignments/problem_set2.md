## Day 2 Assignment:

Hand in a .rmd file saved as “FirstInitialLastname_Day2.rmd” that has markdown explanations and coding chunks (with hashed out comments). It is not cheating to use google for help!

## Question 1

1. Write a function that takes one number and raises it to the power of a second number.
 
2. Write a function called multiply_it, which takes three inputs: a numeric value x, a numeric value y, and a numeric value z. The function will return the product of these three numeric values, which is x * y* z. For example, multiply_it(4, 6,2) will return output 48. At least one of the three passed arguments should have a default value.
 
3. Call the following with an anonymous function that takes one number and raises it to the power of itself (this solution should be similar to Q1):
```
      evaluate <- function(func, dat){
                    return(func(dat))

      }
```

4. Write out two different ways of creating a vector that only contains the even numbers between 0 and 20 (You could use a higher order function, a built-in function, or you could define your own function).
 

U a higher order function to create a vector that multiplies each element by itself. Print out the resulting vector to the screen.
