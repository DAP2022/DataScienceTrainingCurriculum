# Introduction to R I

** This is a 12-hour mini-course that is part of the Jackson Laboratory Data Science Training Program **  
The syllabus can be downloaded [here.](IntroRISyllabus_2026.docx)

## Course Description: 
This workshop is the first of two workshops that constitute a broad survey of the R programming language, a major language central in the fields of bioinformatics, genomics, statistics, and Data Science. No prior programming experience is required. We will use RStudio (now called “Posit”), installed prior to the beginning of the course. After completion of this initial class, there will be a second half offered later in the year (R II) which will cover packages important in Data Science (for example: NumPy, Pandas) and basic statistical analysis capabilities of R. We will use .qmd instead of .rmd files. 

## Course Goals: 
This course will provide you with the tools to analysis data. By the end of the week, you will be able to:
- Navigate the Posit (RStudio) interface and use the RMarkdown Language to document analysis
- Understand the syntax and structure of R
- Understand and apply core R data structures: vectors, lists, data frames, and matrices.
- Create basic scripts in R focused on importing, transforming, and visualizing data
- Use built-in tools to visualize data in a reproducible way
- Use ggplot2 to visualize data

## Course Material
There will be five modules that will be in .rmd format. 
There is an overview and downloadable .rmd files.  
(if you are using GitHub path, the content of the files will appear online when you click on "Download"; if you are using the website, you must download them and open them using You can open these using Google Colab or you can use whatever your favourite Jupyter Notebook software is....)
