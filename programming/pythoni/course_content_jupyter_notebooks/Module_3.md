## Resources:
- The best way to learn to code initially is to have a running explanation of what you *THINK* your code is doing. You can then compare this to what your code *ACTUALLY* does. Being curious about any resulting discrepancy and using fundamental troubleshooting skills (print statements, code comments, and googling any exceptions that your code raises) are your two most prized tools in your coding adventure.
