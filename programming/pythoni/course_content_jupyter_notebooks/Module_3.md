## Module 3A: For Loops

What is "pseudocode"?

There is technical definition of pseudocode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PseudocodeLinks to an external site.), but I was use the term more liberally. For our purposes: Pseudocode is simply listing how you might break down the problem; you don’t have to solve it or produce actual working code. It is about trying to think about how a computer/machine would break down a complex problem into individual, component mini problems.

### LO:
Recognize:
- Opportunity for repetition and
- Syntax of for loops
- Enumeration, range, zip
- Sort() – modifies in place (original list)
- List comprehension is a for loop reduced to one line
Implement:
- For loop

## Module 3B: Conditions & Loops

### LO:
Recognize:
- How conditions are evaluated
- How to get out of a while loop
Implement:
- Conditional loops

### Resources:

The best way to learn to code initially is to have a running explanation of what you *THINK* your code is doing. You can then compare this to what your code *ACTUALLY* does. Being curious about any resulting discrepancy and using fundamental troubleshooting skills (print statements, code comments, and googling any exceptions that your code raises) are your two most prized tools in your coding adventure.
