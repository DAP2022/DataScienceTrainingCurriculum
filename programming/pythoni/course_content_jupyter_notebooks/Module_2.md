## Module 2AB: Lists & Tuples

1. Lists:
- Homogenous data types
- Methods: Access individual values; slice; replace; append; join; pop
2. Tuples:
- immutable lists with heterogenous data (row out of excel); faster than lists; use ()
- Tuples can be keys in dictionaries

    - Start counting at 0
    - How lists point to memory is a bit different than strings or integers ïƒ  scope of lists is different than strings/integers
    - Methods for each data type
    - Benefits of an immutable data type
-Implement:
    - Appropriate methods of data types including slicing
    - There are many ways to add items to a list or remove items from a list, but they work through different mechanisms so make sure you understand the details of each method.
