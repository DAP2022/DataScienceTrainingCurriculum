## Please hand in a Jupyter notebook named LastName_FirstInitial_Mod2.ipynb with at least two parts for each question: 

1. A markdown chunk that explains the logic of your answer.

2. A python coding chunk that has the code for your answer (with any comments). 

-----------------------------------

## Question 1: 
Building on the Pseudocode question in class: We all know that there is degeneracy in the universal genetic code. This means that every amino acid has one or more nucleotide codons. Given a nucleotide string: "ATGGCTTTC", and you want to translate it into amino acids using a list of codons.
A.	How would you break the string into codons (3 bases each)?
B.	How could you look up each codon in a list that maps codons to amino acids?
C.	Write pseudocode that shows the basic steps.

## Question 2:
You are given the following list of tuples, where each tuple contains a student name and a tuple of three exam scores:
grades = [("Elsa",(90,89,95)),("John", (91, 88, 94)),("Terry", (80, 100, 90))]
A.	How can you iterate through this list of tuples to print each studentâ€™s name and their scores?
B.	How can you calculate the average score for each student?
C.	(Bonus) Can you create a new list of tuples in the form: ("Name", average_score)?
