## Please hand in a Jupyter notebook named LastName_FirstInitial_Mod5.ipynb with at least two parts for each question: 

1. A markdown chunk that explains the logic of your answer.

2. A python coding chunk that has the code for your answer (with any comments). 

-----------------------------------

## PLEASE SUBMIT FOR YOUR DAY 5 Completion activity: 

(We will work on this question together during class so you can submit by the end of the class): 

1. Use the dictionary in Module5AB to translate the ORF from your sequence into a string of Amino Acids. 

Hint:  To solve this problem easily, you need to first recognize that there are three major components/sub-problems that you have to solve. 

1. You need to split the nucleotide sequence into codons.     

-    we have already learned how to ‘pull out’ parts of strings - now we just need to ‘automate’  process
-    recognize that each codon is three nucleotides long

2. Translate each codon into the appropriate amino acid

-    The given dictionary would come in handy here!

3. Create a protein by adding all the amino acids together
