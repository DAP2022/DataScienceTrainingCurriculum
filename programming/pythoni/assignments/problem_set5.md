-----------------------------------

## PLEASE SUBMIT FOR YOUR DAY 5 Completion activity: 

## Question 1:
We worked through the first four of the REGEX questions. Please complete the remaining four questions (their solutions will look similar to the ones we did in class).

## Question 2: 
Use regex to solve the following question:
Using a for loop turn the following sequence (it can be hard-coded into your cell) into a list of codons:  5â€™- ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAATCATAGCTATGCATGCTACTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTAACATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACTAGTACTAT-3'. You should end up with a list that prints ["ATC","GAT", etc].
