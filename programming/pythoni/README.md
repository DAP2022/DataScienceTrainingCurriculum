# Programming in Python I

** This is a 12-hour mini-course that is part of the Jackson Laboratory Data Science Training Program ** 

Learn Python basics, data manipulation, and analysis.

## Course Learning Outcomes  
By the end of this course, students will be able to use the Python programming language and do the following:
- Clearly deconstruct a problem into manageable smaller problems.
- Apply appropriate (and efficient) programming tools to solve a problem.
- Understand and interpret other peoples' code.
- Identify problems/deficiencies in existing code (ie. 'troubleshoot' code, your own code as well as peers) and reformulate the code with incorporated improvements.
- Be able to explain your solution to your peers.

## Content: The following topics will be covered
- Python syntax and grammar
- Data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples) and their associated methods
- Data manipulation, file management, and debugging
- Loops, logic, and decision-making
- Regular Expressions
  
## Lecture notes (Python I: Jupyter notebooks)
There is an overview and downloadable .ipynb files.  
(if you are using GitHub path, the content of the files will appear online; if you are using the website, you must download them and open them using You can open these using Google Colab or you can use whatever your favourite Jupyter Notebook software is....)
