# Biostatistics II: Module 2AB Questions: 

1. Which t-test would be appropriate for each of the following scenarios? Write: One sample, Paired or Two sample for each number. 

  A. A new educational software is claimed to improve students' math scores. A teacher tests the software with a group of 25 students. The students' average pre-test score is 70, and their average post-test score is 73, with a standard deviation of 5. Is there enough evidence to support the claim that the software improves scores?

  B. A survey is conducted to compare the levels of job satisfaction between employees from two different departments in a company. Department A has 25 employees with an average job satisfaction score of 7.8 on a 10-point scale and a standard deviation of 1.2. Department B has 30 employees with an average job satisfaction score of 8.3 and a standard deviation of 1.0. Test if there is a significant difference in job satisfaction between the two departments.

  C. A researcher wants to test whether a new study technique improves test scores. They measure the test scores of 10 students before and after using the technique. The scores are as follows. Is there is a significant improvement in test scores?  **Before**: 72, 68, 75, 70, 80, 74, 69, 77, 72, 81  **After**: 78, 73, 80, 75, 85, 79, 74, 82, 77, 86

  D. A coffee shop advertises that their coffee contains an average of 200 milligrams of caffeine per cup. A quality control specialist randomly tests 15 cups of coffee and finds an average caffeine content of 195 milligrams with a standard deviation of 8 milligrams. Is there evidence to suggest that the average caffeine content is different from the advertised amount?

  E. A pharmaceutical company wants to compare the effects of two different drugs on reducing blood pressure. Drug X is administered to 15 patients, and their average reduction in blood pressure is 12 mmHg with a standard deviation of 4 mmHg. Drug Y is administered to 18 patients, with an average reduction of 15 mmHg and a standard deviation of 5 mmHg. Determine if there is a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between the two drugs.

  F. A manufacturer claims that their batteries last an average of 300 hours. An engineer tests 12 batteries and finds that they last an average of 295 hours with a standard deviation of 10 hours. Test whether there is enough evidence to dispute the manufacturer’s claim.

  G. A nutritionist wants to evaluate the impact of a dietary supplement on cholesterol levels. They measure the cholesterol levels of 12 patients before and after 3 months of taking the supplement. The levels are given below. Is there a significant reduction in cholesterol levels after taking the supplement.  **Before**: 210, 220, 215, 205, 225, 230, 225, 210, 220, 225, 215, 200  **After**: 200, 210, 205, 195, 210, 215, 210, 200, 205, 215, 205, 190

  H. A company wants to assess the effectiveness of a new training program on employee performance. They measure the performance scores of 8 employees before and after the training. The scores are given below. Is there a significant difference in performance scores before and after the training?**Before**: 88, 92, 85, 90, 89, 87, 93, 91  **After**: 91, 95, 88, 92, 91, 90, 96, 94  

  I. A university is comparing the effectiveness of two different teaching methods. Method A is used with 20 students, who have average exam scores of 82 with a standard deviation of 6. Method B is used with 22 students, who have average exam scores of 78 with a standard deviation of 7. Test whether there is a significant difference in exam scores between the two methods.

2. Pick **just one** of the following questions and conduct a full hypothesis test:
    
  1. Two species of net-casting spiders, deinopsis  and menneus, co-exist in eastern Australia, a place that – in my opinion - produces a disproportionate number of deadly organisms. The following summary statistics about the size of the prey of these two species were obtained. With 95% confidence: Are the two population variances the same? 

| |deinopsis| menneus|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| n  |  10  |10|
|$\bar{x}$ | 10.26 mm| 9.02 |
|$\sigma^{2}$| $(2.51)^{2}$|$(1.90)^{2}$|

2. A farmer decides to try out a new fertilizer on a test plot containing 10 stalks of corn. Before applying the fertilizer, he measures the height of each stalk. Two weeks later, he measures the stalks again. The stalks would have grown an average of four inches during that time even without the fertilizer. Did the fertilizer help? Use α =0.05
 
|Stalk |1| 2| 3 | 4|5|6| 7 | 8|9 | 10|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Before |35.5 | 31.7|31.2 |36.3 |22.8 |28.0 |24.6 |26.1 |34.5 |27.7 |
| After | 45.3|36.0 |38.6 | 44.7| 31.4| 33.5|28.8|35.8 | 42.9|35.0 |


3. A study was performed among patients with piriformis syndrome (PFD). A randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed where patients were injected with a placebo or Botox. Patients were asked to return at 3 months post-injection and to rate their improvement in pain (large numbers were most improved). The patients were NOT matched by SES, or other features, and were randomly sampled from a patient pool.  They had either placebo or Botox injected (no-one had both injected). 

|Group| $\bar{x}$ | sd|	N|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Placebo | 19.8 |	20.9 | 11|
|Botox | 49.7 |	38.2 | 19 |
