# Biostatistics II: Module 3AB Questions

1. You are studying the expression levels of a gene involved in immune response across three different strains of mice (Strain A, Strain B, Strain C). The goal is to determine whether there are significant differences in mean gene expression across these three strains and, if there is, identify which strains are significantly different. 

|Strain| $\bar{x}$ | $\sigma^2$|	N|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|A | 12.5 | 2.1 | 10|
|B | 15.2 |	2.3 | 10 |
|C | 18.7 |	2.0 | 10 |

2. Researchers want to explore the relationship between gene length (in kilobases) and gene expression (in TPM) in a sample of 15 genes from a particular mouse strain. Is there a significant relationship between gene length and gene expression? 

|Characteristic| $\bar{x}$ | $\sigma^2$|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Gene Length | 8.2 kb |1.5 kb | 
|Gene Expression| 120 TPM |	15 TPM | 

The correlation coefficient is **r=0.65**. Interpret this value and test the significance of the correlation. You do not need to provide a confidence interval!
