# Biostatistics II: Module 1AB Questions

1. Test the hypothesis that the mean cholesterol level of recent Asian immigrants is different from the mean in the general U.S. population using the following information: Cholesterol levels in women ages 21-40 is normally distributed with mean 190 mg/dL, and recent Asian immigrants have normally distributed cholesterol levels. A sample of 200 female Asian immigrants ages 21-40 had fasting serum-cholesterol levels measured and had a mean 181.52 mg/dL with a standard deviation of 40 mg/dL.  

2. Conduct a complete Hypothesis test on the following: Let X be the number of defects in printed circuit boards. A random sample of n = 60 printed circuit boards is taken, and the number of defects were recorded:
   
|Number of Defects | Observed Frequency|
|:---:|:---:|
|0|32|
|1|15|
|2|9|
|3|4|

	Please explain your answer to the following: Does the assumption of a Poisson distribution seem appropriate as a model for these data?
