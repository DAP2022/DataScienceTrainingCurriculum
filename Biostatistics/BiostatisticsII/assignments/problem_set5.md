# Biostatistics II: Module 5AB Questions

1. You want to analyze gene expression data from different strains of mice to understand how their genes respond to varying environmental conditions. You use k-means clustering to group these genes into 3 clusters based on their expression patterns (low, medium, high). Explain – at a very high level conceptual level, no math necessary, but you might want to use the website that was referenced in the K-means section!) – how K-means decides which genes belong to which cluster? What are centroids and what is their role in this process? What happens if two data points are equi-distant from two centroids? What happens if there is a lot of overlap with the data points? 

2. You are studying the gene expression profiles of different mouse tissues (e.g. liver, brain, kidney) to find patterns in how genes behaves across tissues. The dataset is large, with thousands of genes and multiple conditions. You decide to use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the complexity of this data set and visualize it. Explain (at a high level) how PCA helps you identify patterns in the gene expression data, and what does it mean when a particular tissue type appears close to others in a PCA plot? Explain what the principal components are? 

3. If the original sample data has n points, then a bootstrap sample should have:
   
A. Fewer points than the original because there is less information in the sample than in the underlying distribution.

B. The same number of points as the original because we want the bootstrap statistic to mimic the statistic on the original data. 

C. Many more points than the original because we have the computing power to handle a lot of data. 

4. Draw two scatterplots. One will represent the real relationship between body size and brain size for 29 species of dinosaur and the other shows the first randomized data set created from that same data. Explain the patterns that would differentiate these two graphs.
