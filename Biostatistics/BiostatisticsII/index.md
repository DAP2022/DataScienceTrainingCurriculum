Topics covered in this second workshop will focus on focus on Hypothesis Testing and will include: Hypothesis testing as a reproducible pipeline, comparing means and medians of two (student’s t tests/Mann-Whitney U tests/Sign test) or more (ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis) populations, investigating and applying basic supervised machine learning techniques (correlation, linear/logistic/multiple linear regression), and slightly more sophisticated unsupervised machine learning techniques (k-means, Principal Component Analysis). We will also spend time learning about the non-parametric versions of hypothesis testing, including bootstrap resampling, permutations, and simulation.

The following topics will be covered in Biostatistics II: 
- Student’s t tests (one sample, paired, and two sample); Nonparametric versions: Wilcoxon one sample Signed-Rank test, and Mann Whitney U test
- ANOVA, Tukey’s honestly significant test; Nonparametric versions: Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA, Dunn post-hoc test
- Supervised learning: Linear Correlation; Nonparametric version: Spearman rank-order correlation; Linear Regression, and some general linear models like multivariate regression, ANCOVA
- Unsupervised learning: Categorization, such as k-means clustering, Dimension reduction such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
