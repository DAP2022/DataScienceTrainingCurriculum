## Biostatistics I: Module 1A Questions

A. Can the Standard deviation ever be zero? If so, when would that situation occur?

B. Imagine that we have a population that is skewed to the left. This population has a mean of 112 and a standard deviation of 16. Using a simulation program, Tyler simulated drawing 1000 samples of size 2 from the population. He then plotted the means for each of the samples that he drew. Alex simulated drawing 1000 samples of size 30, and he also plotted the means for each of the samples that he drew. 

    i. Would you expect the shape of Tyler’ s distribution of sample means to differ from the shape of Alex’s distribution of sample means? Please explain your answer (i.e., If you do expect the shapes to differ, how will they differ? If you do not expect the shapes to differ, why not?)
  
    ii. Is the mean of Tyler’s distribution of sample means <,>, or = to the mean of Alex’s distribution of sample means and to the mean of the sample?
  
    iii. How would you rank, from largest to smallest, the following: the standard deviation of  Tyler’s distribution of sample means, the standard deviation of Alex’s distribution of sample means, and the standard deviation of the sample itself?

# Biostatistics I: Module 1B Questions

Identify a graph from a favourite publication and explain the following:
1. Identify the variables and their type. 
2. What is the graph showing (or trying to show)?
3. Is the graph effective? Why or why not? 
4. What improvements would you recommend for the graph and why?
