# Biostatistics I: Module 2A Questions:
A man went to Monte Carlo to try and make his fortune. Whilst he was there, he had an opportunity to bet on the outcome of rolling dice. He was offered the same odds for each of the following outcomes (in each case the dice are rolled simultaneously):

		i. At least 1 six with 6 dice.
		ii. At least 2 sixes with 12 dice.
		iii. At least 3 sixes with 18 dice.
    
The man decided that these were all the same so he could choose one at random and bet on that. Was he right? Give your answer and explanation (in your own words). Note: to answer iii, you will need to use the binomial coefficient (we will cover this in 3A). I included this so you can see how probability connects to what we will focus on next and because you have been given the answer (you only must indicate by explaining the solution yourself that you truly understand the answer). 

2. Here is the question that you can imagine represents migration between two originally isolated populations which, as you will recall from your biology courses, is one of the forces that shapes genetic variation (stolen from https://nrich.maths.org/1970)
    1. There are 5 yellow balls in bag One. One ball is transferred to bag Two which contains an unknown number of green balls.
    2. Bag Two is then shaken and a ball is selected at random and transferred to bag One without seeing its colour.
    3. Bag One  is then shaken and a ball is selected at random and transferred to bag Two without seeing its colour.
    4. Finally, a ball is chosen at random from bag Two.
If I tell you before you carry out this process that there is a 3/5 chance you will end up with a green ball at the end, can you work out how many green balls are in bag Two at the start? Draw a probability diagram (showing your solution) and explain the logic of your answer in your own words.
Hint: You are following the state space of each of the two bags in this question. They start out as the following representation: (5,0)(0,n), as there are 5 yellow balls in bag 1 initially, and 0 yellow balls in bag 2, as well as an unknown number of green balls in bag 2. Note: There will be a bit of algebra involved in the solution, but we will discuss it in next class – just do your best! You can find the answer to this question online, too, but you will need to use your own words to explain your solution. *If you can successfully answer this question, you have a solid understanding of conditional probability!*

# Biostatistics I: Module 2B Questions: 

1. Suppose you work in a psychiatric institution and a patient is referred to you by the GP because of an elevated score on a depression questionnaire. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the practice of this GP, 10% of patients have depression (the ‘prevalence’ of the disorder).
If a patient has depression, the likelihood that they have a positive score on this depression questionnaire is 90% (the ‘sensitivity’ of the test). 
A patient who does not have depression has an 80% chance of a negative score (the ‘specificity’ of the test)

WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE THAT THE PATIENT HAS DEPRESSION?
