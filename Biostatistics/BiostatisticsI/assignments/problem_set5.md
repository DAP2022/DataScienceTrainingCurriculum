Using the following data, estimate the OR in favour of Myocardial Infarction (MI) over three years for an OC user compared with a non-OC user (i.e. the disease odds ratio): 

|OC-use group\MI incidence (3 years)| Yes| No|
|:----:|:---:|:----:|
| Yes  | 13 | 4987|
|No| 7| 9993|

# Biostatistics I: Module 5B Questions

Finish up any outstanding questions from class
The natural log of growth (change in radius per year in mm) of a species of spruce tree is normally distributed with a mean  =0.0307 log units and a standard deviation of 0.385. 

a. What is the probability that a tree has a ‘bad year’, defined as having growth less than -0.05 log units in a year? 

b. Make a sketch of the normal distribution with a mean of 0.037 and mark the values that we are trying to determine (i.e. those values less than -0.05)

c. Calculate the Z-score associated with the value. -0.05. 

d. We are interested in getting a value less than this Z value. Can we get it directly from the table or do we need to do something else to get the value? 

e. What is the probability that a random draw from a standard normal distribution will be greater than 0.226?
