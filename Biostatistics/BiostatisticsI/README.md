# Biostatistics I
** This 12-hour mini-course is part of The Jackson Laboratory Foundational Data Science Training Curriculum **
1.	Course Description: 
This 12-hour course is the first of three linked courses that constitute a broad survey of the field of biostatistics. This learning pathway will familiarize participants with statistical concepts necessary to evaluate the primary literature in the biological sciences. It will improve learners’ statistical literacy and sharpen analytical thinking. Topics covered in this first workshop will include: descriptive statistics and graphics, estimation, elementary probability theory, Bayes’ theorem, statistical distributions, hypothesis testing, power, sensitivity and specificity, and goodness of fit tests. 

2.	Goals:
Statistics is not just a related series of equations that you can memorize, it is training yourself to an entirely new way of thinking. Statistical thinking is applied epistemology – how do we know what we know and how do we quantify that?  Can we evaluate evidence and decide consistent criteria to apply to decision making? Can we design experiments that effectively test what you are trying to test and how we ensure that we have tested what we think we are testing? 

At the end of this set of three courses, you will be able to break down complex problems into their component pieces, identify which of these components are important to the hypothesis that you are testing, apply the appropriate statistical test and, of course, to quantify the uncertainty inherent in your conclusion and your data. Embrace diagraming flowcharts – they will be helpful in developing a heuristic about what tests to utilize under what circumstances! Much of the field of applied statistics, and therefore this course, is concerned with attributing variation to either 'noise' or 'signal' and logically justifying the steps you take in analyzing data sets.  

The following topics will be covered in Biostatistics I: 
•	Descriptive statistics
•	Data types and how to visualize data
•	Probability rules: addition/multiplication/conditional
•	Bayes’ theorem
•	Likelihood (with reference to applications in QTL and LOD scores)
•	Variation and Standard Error
•	Common distributions: Binomial, Normal, Poisson, Hypergeometric
•	Hypothesis testing, including answering the question “what IS a p-value?” and quantifying how much uncertainty we are comfortable with in experimental design. 
•	Chi-squared tests (nonparametric, Goodness of fit and contingency)
•	OR (with reference to use in GWAS)
•	Z scores (relevant for RNAseq and many other situations)
