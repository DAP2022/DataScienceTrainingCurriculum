# Statistics Pipeline

** These are three courses that provide the statistical training offered by The Jackson Laboratory as part of their Data Science Curriculum**

Statistics provides a framework for weighing and evaluating EVIDENCE. It is applied epistemology. 
Bayes’ and frequentist statistics bring slightly different philosophies to the table: Bayes is a quantification of personal
belief (rooted in Hume; the parameter value is unknowable), frequentist is rooted in the idea of objective truth (there is
an actual unknown, perhaps unknowable, parameter value) that you can get at by repeating an experiment/experience many 
many times. 

Our brains rebel against uncertainty, we view it as stressful, so we need to train our intuition to overcome this tendancy. 
We do this by practising analysis: descriptive statistics, probability, inference with hypothesis testing.

# Biostatistics I: 
Course Description: 
This workshop is the first of three workshops that constitute a broad survey of the field of biostatistics. This course will
familiarize students with statistical concepts necessary to evaluate the primary literature in the biological sciences. It 
will improve students’ statistical literacy and sharpen analytical thinking. Topics covered in this first workshop will 
include: descriptive statistics and graphics, estimation, elementary probability theory, Bayes’ theorem, statistical 
distributions, hypothesis testing, power, sensitivity and specificity, and goodness of fit tests. 

Statistics is not just a related series of equations that you can memorize; it involves training yourself to an entirely 
new way of thinking. Statistics is about evaluating evidence and deciding consistent criteria to apply to support decision
making and designing experiments that effectively test what you are trying to test! At the end of this set of workshops, you 
should be able to break down complex problems into their component pieces, identify which of these components are important
to the hypothesis that you are testing, apply the appropriate statistical test and, of course, to quantify the uncertainty 
inherent in your conclusion and your data. Embrace diagraming flowcharts – they will be helpful in developing a heuristic 
about what tests to utilize under what circumstances! Much of the field of applied statistics, and therefore this course,
is concerned with attributing variation to either 'noise' or 'signal' and logically justifying the steps you take in 
analyzing data sets.  

The following topics will be covered: 
- Descriptive statistics
- Data types and how to visualize them
- Probability rules: addition/multiplication/conditional
- Bayes’ theorem
- Likelihood and QTL (LOD scores)
- Variation and Standard Error
- Common distributions: Binomial, Normal, Poisson, Hypergeometric
- Hypothesis testing, including answering the question “what IS a p-value?” and quantifying how much uncertainty are we comfortable with in experimental design.
- Chi-squared tests (nonparametric, Goodness of fit and contingency)
- OR/RR


# Biostatistics II: 
Course Description: 
This workshop is the second of three workshops that constitute a broad survey of the field of biostatistics. This course will
familiarize students with statistical concepts necessary to evaluate the primary literature in the biological sciences. It will
improve students’ statistical literacy and sharpen analytical thinking. Topics covered in this second workshop of the series 
will include: p-hacking, Z scores, common parametric tests (t-tests, ANOVA, Correlation, different types of Regression, aka 
“Machine Learning”) and their nonparametric counterparts.   

The following topics will be covered: 
- Reproducibility and trustworthiness of results (dastardly p-hacking)
- Z-scores
- Parametric: T-tests, ANOVA, Correlation, Regression (linear, multiple, logistic), ANCOVA
- Transformation, nonparametric versions, simulations, dimension reduction

# Biostatistics III: 
Course Description: 
Topics covered in this third workshop will focus on experimental design, and include qualitative tools, and 
Causal Analysis (with an emphasis on DAGs, and Mendelian Randomization). 

The following topics will be covered: 
- Power, sensitivity, specificity; experimental design
- Qualitative methods
- Causal Inference (Why? What? DAGs, IV, MR)
- Meta-analysis
- Additional Machine learning methods (TBA, overflow from prior courses)
